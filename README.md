# AUTONOMUS_VEH
This project focuses on developing an autonomous vehicle system using sensor fusion techniques, camera-based object detection, and steering control algorithms. The system integrates data from cameras, LiDAR, and ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles, estimate distances, and make real-time steering adjustments.
